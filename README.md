## Rules & Regulation ðŸš€

<img align="right" alt="GIF"  src="image\B5q6V.jpg" />
  <ul>
    <li><b>Runs</b>: This is a unit of scoring. Basically like 'points' for people with no cricketing background.</li>
    <li><b>Wickets</b>: This is a really good way to prevent opponents from scoring. It is sort of like 'lives' in a game. If you pick all the wickets, then the opponent can't score any runs.</li>
    <li><b>Overs</b>: This is a limiting factor for the game. If you don't get all the wickets of the opponent, the only thing that stops the opponent from scoring is the overs. When the opponent has completed batting all the overs, they can't score anymore.</li>
  </ul>
