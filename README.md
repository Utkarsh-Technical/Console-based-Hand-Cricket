# Hand Cricket

This is a simple Hand-Cricket Game that was built using <strong>Java, OOPs concepts, and Data Structures</strong>. 
The game is based on the popular cricket game that is played in India and other cricket-loving countries.

## Feature

- The game is played between two players, one of whom is the bowler and the other is the batsman.
- The bowler bowls a ball, and the batsman tries to score runs by hitting the ball with his/her hand.
- The game has several levels, each with a different number of overs and target scores.
- The game uses object-oriented programming concepts to create classes for the game, players, overs, and runs.
- The game also uses data structures such as arrays and lists to store and manipulate the game data.
